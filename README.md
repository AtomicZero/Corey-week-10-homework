# Homework 10 - HTML 10 User Story
As a company manager I want to be able to use command line interface (CLI) for data entry when adding or new staff to my company. The CLI should be able to query contact data for each employee such as name, employee ID, and email. It should then query one additional contact information depending on job role:
* If Intern then query University name
* If Manager then query office phone number
* If Engineer then query Github link
After entering employee data on CLI, the information should then be presented to the preformatted company page.
